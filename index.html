  I create custom coded websites, like this one which is ever changing. But I also work on Squarespace to bring your vision to life!
  <br><br>
  I also work in digital marketing with a focus in Pinterest. Haven't added Pinterest to your marketing strategy? Check out this post on how Pinterest can help grow your business!
