      <h2> What's Social Media Marketing? </h2>
    </button>
      <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Think about how many times you post a new tweet onto your Twitter account or how often you'll click through your favorite Instagrammers' stories. <br>  Current and potential clients are doing the exact same! <br> <br> Social media marketing is an invaluable tool that helps you reach prospects and customers. Creating a successful social media profile can help you boost traffic to your business, create a loyal following, and even <span> drive leads and sales!</span> <br> <br> But it's not just about getting followers, it's about attracting and keeping the <span>right followers </span>who will continue to engage with your pages and your products. <br> <br> How? That's where I come in.

  <h2> Pinterest Marketing </h2>
</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
    I have worked with Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Mailchimp, and Drip but I specialize in <span> Pinterest</span>. Why?<br><br>
    <!-- Here's a look at why these two are my absolute favorites! <br><br></p> <h2>Instagram</h2> <p> <br> After Facebook and a few chatting apps, Instagram is the top social media application that serves to promote products and brands, draw in followers and customers, and even lead to sales (sometimes directly on the account itself!). </p> <br> <br> -->
  <p> Pinterest works as a search engine, kind of like Google, and is a tool that should not be underestimated. <br><br> 250 million people use Pinterest. 59% of millenials discover new products on Pinterest all the time. Think of what kind of audience you would be tapping into! <br> <br> Using Pinterest can help drive traffic to your channels and your website, creating a loyal audience, and even encourage sales!</p>
  <br> <br>
  <p> But I also work with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Houzz! So if you're looking to grow your brand profile, drop me a line! </p>

    <h2> The Process </h2>
  </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> Once you've sent me an email, we'll set up a chat (usually via Skype or Facetime) to hear more about your business needs and what services I can offer. <br> <br> From here I will draft a custom proposal and quote. If all sounds good, I'll send over a contract and we'll get to creating asap!
