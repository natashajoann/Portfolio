When I first started coding, I came across so many beautiful websites that had such cool features. One of my favorites was (and still is) a fixed background. It felt like such a cool way of adding personality without having to overwhelm your visitors with a billion photos. Plus, it's the perfect way of braking up a long landing page.

First things first, what is a fixed background? It's exacly what it sounds like: you have an image working as a background with content that scrolls on top. Like this:

<div class="mycodepen">
<p class="codepen" data-height="336" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="natashajoann" data-slug-hash="GRoErBY" style="height: 336px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Fixed Background">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/natashajoann/pen/GRoErBY">
  Fixed Background</a> by natasha (<a href="https://codepen.io/natashajoann">@natashajoann</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
</div>

<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Pretty cool huh?

And it's pretty easy. Ready?
