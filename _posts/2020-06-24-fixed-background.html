When I first started coding, I came across so many beautiful websites that had such cool features. One of my favorites was (and still is) a fixed background. It felt like such a cool way of adding personality without having to overwhelm your visitors with a billion photos. Plus, it's the perfect way of braking up a long landing page.

First things first, what is a fixed background? It's exacly what it sounds like: you have an image working as a background with content that scrolls on top. Like this:

<div class="blog-paralax">
</div>

Pretty cool huh?

And it's pretty easy. Ready?
