    <h3> No Reservations: Gender Performance in Celebrity Chefs (Thesis)</h3>
    <h4> May 2018 </h4>

Celebrity chefs’ public performances provide information on how gender is understood and established within this field. More importantly, celebrity chefs have the opportunity to reinforce or inspire change to gender norms through their public performances. By focusing on this gastronomical microcosm, through this research we can better understand gender norms and ideologies within American culture as a whole  </p> -->
