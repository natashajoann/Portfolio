As you start off on your digital nomad journey, there are tons and tons of articles and blog posts covering the basics: how to find the best places to work (stand outside a cafe and check your phone for their wifi name before going in), top destinations for freelancers, where to find work online (for the love of god, get the hell off of UpWork and try networking instead–it makes ALL the difference), what to pack in your bag, etc.

&nbsp;

To be quite honest, these are just a few of the many things you will fuck up and figure out as you go. Creating an online community that you can rely on for support and work comes with time and experience (although I've got a useful little guide coming to help you get your foot in the door). Learning to talk about your services and pitch on the fly confidently comes with practice. No freelancer ever started off in the perfect position, they've all had to self-educate, ask a billion questions, seek out help, and find their weaknesses as they go.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But if there are any things you can do right straight off the bat, it's these four:&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Find a reliable time-tracker AND STICK TO IT

&nbsp;

I can't tell you how many times I've started a stopwatch on my phone, forgotten about it for 3 days, gone back and had no idea when I started, what I was working on, or how long it took. Ask any freelancer out there–we've all been there. Instead, find a FREE online service that not only tracks your work schedule, but offers tools to track your time and tag your activities. My personal fave? [And.Co](https://www.and.co/){: target="_blank"} . While they will continuously promote their Pro-features, their free account does the trick. (note: it's tempting to want to upgrade and access their invoicing services but I'd rather use [this invoice generator](https://invoice-generator.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;for FREE). Plus, you can even download your timesheet onto a handy-dandy spreadsheet to share with clients who insist on reviewing your hours and work summary.&nbsp;

### Stay organized from the beginning…without paying for any online services.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Anyone else been confused by the complexity of Notion.io or frustrated with Asana boards?&nbsp; Instead try…&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### *\- Daily/Weekly Planners&nbsp;*

Remember [this post](https://natashaverdon.com/2020/06/24/how-to-stay-productive-as-a-freelancer-when-youre-on-the-road.html){: target="_blank"}?&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### *\- Client Google Drives*

Organization is key. Before starting on any project, set up a folder dedicated to your client. Put in your questionnaire, contract, invoices, inspo, and designs. Later, once your project is finished, put in any tax forms and client info/guides they'll need once their site is live\!&nbsp;

### Stop Fussing over your portfolio…

&nbsp;

I have re-built this website over 5x. In fact, most times after I finish a project I think of new ways I can update my site. Hell–when I first started building it, it took me almost 6 months to finally take the plunge and just launch it\!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I always found reasons to hold off, update, re-make and re-structure my portfolio but at the end of the day I had to decide: launch the site and see what happens, or keep putting it off&nbsp; and miss ALL potential for new clients. Which one would you choose?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Think about what you WON'T do when you're writing your contract

&nbsp;

I'm embarrassed to say, it has taken me two years to finally figure out what I should and shouldn't put in my client contracts. It wasn't until a few months ago that someone finally asked me, "what services do you NOT offer as part of your monthly maintenance?" It was something I had never considered.

&nbsp;

\*What does maintenance mean? How many alterations would I offer per maintenance period? How many files per alteration? \*

&nbsp;

These were all things *I* knew but my client did not. If I couldn't communicate them well, they would take advantage of my services.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Set limits for your projects, define late-payment fees, determine what deliverables clients can use without paying for licensing, etc. &nbsp;And for the love of god, make sure they sign and return the contract ***before*** you start anything at all.&nbsp;
