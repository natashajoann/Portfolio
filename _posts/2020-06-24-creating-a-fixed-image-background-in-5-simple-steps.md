When I first started coding, I came across so many beautiful websites that had such cool features. One of my favorites was (and still is) a fixed background. It felt like such a cool way of adding personality without having to overwhelm your visitors with a billion photos. Plus, it's the perfect way of braking up a long landing page.

First things first, what is a fixed background? It's exacly what it sounds like: you have an image working as a background with content that scrolls on top. Like this:

&lt;p class="codepen" data-height="336" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="natashajoann" data-slug-hash="GRoErBY" style="height: 336px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Fixed Background"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;span&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/natashajoann/pen/GRoErBY"&gt;<br>&nbsp; Fixed Background&lt;/a&gt; by natasha (&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/natashajoann"&gt;@natashajoann&lt;/a&gt;)<br>&nbsp; on &lt;a href="https://codepen.io"&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;<br>&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<div class="blog-paralax">&nbsp;</div>

Pretty cool huh?

And it's pretty easy. Ready?
