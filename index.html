  <h1> Hi there I'm Natasha!</h1>
  <p> I’m a Colombian-American designer and developer, and food anthropologist. I create custom coded websites to bring your vision to life, whether you want a completely custom coded site or are looking for help with your Squarespace development.
    <br><br>
  I also work in digital marketing to help grow your brand organically from the ground up. Need a new marketing strategy for Instagram? Curious how to add Pinterest to your marketing plan?

      <p> We came to Natasha with no clear design criteria, except we wanted “clean” and “sophisticated.” With that pittance of direction Natasha delivered beyond all of our expectations. <br> <br>I would, without reservation, recommend Natasha for the design and build of your website. I am proud to provide our clients, potential clients, friends, family, competitors and colleagues with our URL to “check” out us and our practice. All thanks to Natasha! <br><br>- <span class="testie-p">Marcy P., PHH Law Group</span>
