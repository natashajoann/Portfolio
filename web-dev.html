  <h2>The Process</h2>

  <div class="grid process">
  <h2 class="col-3_sm-12">1. The First Meeting </h2>
  <p class="col-9_sm-12"> First things first, send me an email <a href="mailto:natashamverdon@gmail.com"> here</a>. From there we'll set up a time to chat and discuss what you're looking for and how I can help. This will be followed up with a proposal and questionnaire so I can get a better idea of your vision. If you like what you hear then we move on to the next step.</p>

  <br>

  <h2 class="col-3_sm-12"> 2. The Initial Design </h2>
  <p class="col-9_sm-12"> After filling out and sending back the questionnaire, I'll pull samples, palettes, and inspiration along with a design of the website. If you like the design, great! If you're not so sure, no worries we'll keep working until you get the design you love (and remember, more often than not these will change as we build).  </p>

  <br>

  <h2 class="col-3_sm-12">3. The Build </h2>
  <p class="col-9_sm-12">Here come the fun part, building your custom site that is completely mobile responsive. All of my sites come with SEO optimization and the intigration of all of your social media platforms. <br> Now that you've seen a live version of the site, we'll sit down together again to review and make changes where necessary. </p>

  <br>

  <h2 class="col-3_sm-12">4. Website Launch </h2>
  <p class="col-9_sm-12"> Once you're happy with the final look of your site, we'll run through the functions and I will perform a full final check to make sure everything is running smoothly. <br> And here's the fun part for you, your website launch!</p>
