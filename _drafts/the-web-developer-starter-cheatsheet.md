Ready to embark on your web development career? I know how daunting and confusing web dev can be but with enough practice and help from your friends (aka me\!) it gets all the more easy\!

&nbsp;

By now you should know that HTML controls the foundation, skeleton, and content on your website while CSS controls the styling and spacing. Javascript helps add in motion, interactivity, data collection, and reactions to specific triggers.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You've set up your github/Git desktop and downloaded an application to write your code in (I use Atom). Maybe you've even found a place to to push your code so you can see the live version of your creations. But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let's take it back a bit and start the build from the bottom up.&nbsp; Here are my top tips and "to-dos" but fear not, I've created an entire cheatsheet with whole slew of helpful content, html breakdowns, and css tricks\! &nbsp;C**lick here to get yours\!**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Outline and break down your wireframe (link to mine)**
{: .partial-highlight-mint}

&nbsp;

When I start on any new project, I always start off with a pencil and paper (I know it's like being in the middle ages but it helps get the creativity flowing). I'll create or print out wireframes to help guide my preliminary design process. I've even digitized my wireframes and you can snag those **here.&nbsp;**Once I'm happy with the preliminary design, I'll switch over to Adobe XD so I can add in colors, images, and fonts.&nbsp;

Now, once I have all my design files ready to use (hex codes, images, fonts, spacing etc.) I'll actually turn back to my original, paper-drawn design and write out the sections of code. Think of this kind of like outlining an essay. Having things pre-determined allows me to write my code even faster and helps me define spacing or difficult sections of code. It ends up looking something like this:&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Not only will coding become just a bit easier, this helps me stay organized and avoid creating a steaming pile of code-spaghetti. Trust me, you don't want to be disorganized when you're coding--it becomes impossible to find sections and determine what's being used and what isn't.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Brainstorm your classes**
{: .partial-highlight-mint}

&nbsp;

Once you've broken down your wireframe and design, it's time to take the next step in organization: defining your classes. Again, this will help you write your code faster and it'll become intuitive and natural as you continue building more websites.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Brainstorming your classes before coding keeps you from repeating the same classes or creating redundant pieces of code. Create a set of general classes, or "helper classes", that you can add to any element so you don't have to keep adjusting the same values for different elements in your code. This can be things like pre-determined padding/margins, buttons, text formatting etc.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To make this step a bit easier, I've created a whole doc of helper classes you can use on your upcoming build. Write these in your CSS once and then add them to your HTML elements as needed\! Trust me, it'll make styling your page easier, faster, and so much more efficient.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Remember that helpful cheatsheet I mentioned? It's got all the helper classes I use on every single one of my builds and you can get it&nbsp;**here**.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Know what values, elements, and properties to target**
{: .partial-highlight-mint}

&nbsp;

Padding, margins, borders, elements, divs, sections, textareas...the web dev jargon can be confusing and frustrating when you're first starting out. And that's not even starting to cover the never-ending formatting styles\!

&nbsp;

Knowing what and how values target which properties allows you to avoid redundancy (again, no more spaghetti code\!) and ensure your code is displaying exactly the way you want it to be. There are two things to consider here:

&nbsp;

### 1\. the order of your commands
{: .yellow}

> CSS is a cascading sheet, that means that it is read from top to bottom. In other words, whatever comes later in the cascade is what is displayed. This means that if you have command for a background-color for your header at the top of your stylesheet but then added in a new command for background-color for your header lower in the stylesheet then the second command is what will be displayed.&nbsp;
>
>
> (visual)
>
>
> &nbsp;
>
>
> If you have code that just refuses to listen to your commands, take a look at the rest of your stylesheet and make sure you haven't repeated yourself. This is also where having distinct classes comes in handy\!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### 2\. the targeted value:&nbsp;
{: .yellow}

> Sometimes the problem isn't the order or the wrong class at all but rather that you've been targeting the wrong value. I can't tell you how many times I used to confuse font-size and font-weight when I was first starting out. I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong and sometimes would copy my style commands lower in my stylesheet.&nbsp;

> **Use my cheatsheet** to familiarize yourself with which values target which styles so that you can create the exact effect you're looking for without having to add in 10 different commands in an effort to get something to work\!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Familiarize yourself with "Inspect"**
{: .partial-highlight-mint}

&nbsp;

Inspect, aka the holy grail of web dev. If there's anything you take away from this article it should be this: use, and never forget to use, the inspect tool.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Not only does this tool let you explore the code on your own page (in other words, figure out what the hell is broken and how to change it) and sample different css styles, but it also let's you peek in at other peoples' code as well\! Have you ever been to a website and absolutely loved that fade-in feature or wanted to find out what kind of font they're using? Inspect can help\!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### To access it is super simple\!&nbsp;
{: .yellow}

> 1\. Hold down your ctrl button while you right click on your mouse.&nbsp;
>
>
> 2\. At the bottom of the pop-up menu you'll see "Inspect"
>
>
> 3\. Once you click on "Inspect" a panel will open up either on the side or bottom of your browser. The top section is the HTML while the bottom section is the CSS.&nbsp;
>
>
> 4\. Clicking on the button on the top left corner (looks like a cursor over a box) will let you choose specific elements so that you don't have to go rooting through hefty html for that one element you're curious about.&nbsp;
>
>
> 5\. Take some time to play around with inspect. Change padding, find colors, see which classes are being used and where etc.

&nbsp;

This is just the beginning\! Inspect is an incredibly powerful tool that can tell you so much more than just the structure and styling of a page. Eventually, Inspect will also tell you so much more information, like why your JS isn't reacting properly and help you uncover bugs in your code. But for now, we'll stick to the elements control panel.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;These are just the beginning. Before jumping into your project, **take a look at this super helpful cheatsheet I've put together**. On it are all the things I wish I had had on hand while I was muddling through my first few projects. Keeping this handy will let you save time and plenty of frustrations throughout the entirety of your build\!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Happy Coding\!
